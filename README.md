# Joaquin's Filipino Sandwich Store

# Notes (Joaquin)
- Input validation was not a big concern due to the fact that the GUI will have limited selections anyway. 
- Getters and setters are used and no constructors because I believe it would make more sense with the selection boxes of the GUI.
- Some methods may end up being useless, but I added them just in-case
- I used LinkedList because adding, removing, and insertion are significantly faster, which is what I foresee us doing most

# TODO (Owen)
- finish implementation for search by email text box
- get add order panel set up
- get add customer panel set up
- prepare scroll animation
