# Notes (Joaquin)
- Input validation is most of the time not implemented due to the fact that the GUI will have limited selections anyway. 
- Getters and setters are used and no constructors because I believe it would make more sense with the selection boxes of the GUI.
- Some methods may end up being useless, but I added them just in-case
- I used LinkedList because adding, removing, and insertion are significantly faster, which is what I foresee us doing most 

#TODO (Joaquin)
- create a randomized, unique ID for each store
